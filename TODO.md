## Calculators for Formulas
There are a lot of calculations across the different LFs
Embed calculators/converters with explanations

### Calculations that are definitely needed
- Datentransferrate 󰄬
- Datenuebertragung 󰄬 Need to check again though
- Bit/Byte conversion 󰄬
- Druckkostenvergleich
- Netzplan
- Darlehen
- Einfache Buchfuehrung
- Handlungskostenkalkulation
- Zuschlagskostenkalkulation
- Rueckwaertskalkulation
- Gewinnkalkulation
- Stundensatzkalkulationen
- TCO
- ROI
- Angebotsvergleich
- Nutzwertanalyse
- 
- IP Address calculation
  - Calculate NetID, 1st/last Host, Broadcast
  - Calculate Subnetmask based on CIDR
  - Calculate CIRD based on Subnetmask
  - Highlight usable host address and give explanation why it can't be used (it's broadcast or NetId)


## Embed netzplan-app
Rework the app to work on the website or simply link it.

### Need some bug/visual fixes. Those should all be fairly easy to implement
- the linked nodes should move appropriately
- calculations should be done every time a change is made
- colors should change accordingly
- no circles
- visual clarity


## Add mobile layout
Layout must be easily accessible from mobile

## Search optimizations
Check the algorithm again and fix indexing.
Since I read all the content into a json, I should be able to search for everything in there, without any issues.
