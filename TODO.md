## Calculators for Formulas
There are a lot of calculations across the different LFs
Embed calculators/converters with explanations

### Calculations that are definitely needed
- Datentransferrate
- Druckkostenvergleich
- Netzplan
- Darlehen
- Einfache Buchfuehrung
- Handlungskostenkalkulation
- Zuschlagskostenkalkulation
- Rueckwaertskalkulation
- Gewinnkalkulation
- Stundensatzkalkulationen
- TCO
- ROI
- Angebotsvergleich
- Nutzwertanalyse
- Datenuebertragung
- Bit/Byte conversion
- 
- IP Address calculation
  - Calculate NetID, 1st/last Host, Broadcast
  - Calculate Subnetmask based on CIDR
  - Calculate CIRD based on Subnetmask
  - Highlight usable host address and give explanation why it can't be used (it's broadcast or NetId)


## Embed netzplan-app
Rework the app to work on the website or simply link it.

### Need some bug/visual fixes. Those should all be fairly easy to implement
- the linked nodes should move appropriately
- calculations should be done every time a change is made
- colors should change accordingly
- no circles
- visual clarity


## Add mobile layout
Layout must be easily accessible from mobile

## change layout to be a little bit more fluid/useful
Currently the middle section doesn't have much space.
Font sizes might be a little to big, which makes the design feel cramped

On 1920x1080 the middle section should at least be 1280 wide, maybe even around 1500 wide
Menu on the left should always be visible, but not sure for the right menu. Does it always need to be visible, 
or should you be able to toggle it?

## Search optimizations
Check the algorithm again and fix indexing.
Since I read all the content into a json, I should be able to search for everything in there, without any issues.
